/**
 * Selective disclosure — "private by default, provably disclosable."
 *
 * Your order is a public commitment `H = SHA-256(fields ‖ nonce)`; the fields
 * stay hidden. When you *choose* to prove your position to an auditor or
 * counterparty, you hand them a disclosure: the revealed fields + the nonce.
 * They recompute the hash and check it equals the on-chain commitment — proving
 * exactly what you traded, WITHOUT the public ever seeing it. This is Midnight's
 * thesis (rational privacy) applied to a perp: opening a commitment to a chosen
 * party, verifiable against the value already committed on-chain.
